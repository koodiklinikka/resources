Frank's Pancake Recipe
======================

So here goes, once upon a time when I was a young boy jumping from a helicopter.
I finally came to the conclusion of what I want to do with my life.
I had a strong eagerness to become a... Nope, sorry, not that kind of recepie :smile:

1. Mix 3 dl wheat flour, 1.5 tsp baking powder, 2 tsp vanilla sugar, 0.5 tsp salt, 1 tsp cardamom. I usually run them through a strainer as it makes me feel fancy.
2. Melt as much butter as your conscious allows (but a minimum of 2 tbsp).
3. Separately mix 2 dl 3% milk, 2 tbsp Turkish yoghurt, 1 egg and stir it together.
4. Add the melted butter to the rest of the liquids and stir.
5. After you have stopped stirring, immediately mix it with the dry ingredients.
6. Mix it all together, you should get something that moves when you tilt the bowl but it should not be runny and move quickly. If it is too loose, add more flour; if too thick, add milk.
7. Put it in a pan and turn up the heat to 2/3 of max. This is a thing I’ve found really hard to get right on stoves that are not my own. YMMV.
8. You want to keep them there until you see bubbles forming on the top of the pancakes, then you turn them. If you see a bit of smoke coming from them, then you’ve fucked up and burned the pancakes.
9. Serve as stacks of n+1 with butter between the layers and  “a bit” of maple syrup

The base for this recepie is BBCs pancake recepie that I started with 5+ years ago: https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/fluffyamericanpancak_74828
These are still very good as well :blush:  first thing I changed was the sugar, then noticed
that the consistency got a bit nicer with yogurt and then noticed I could trigger my
"pulla"-synapses by adding cardamom :sweat_smile:

Things not to use:

* cream: this makes them dense and the consistency is messed up
* flavored yogurt: I've tried with several kind, it is never as good as plain yoghurt. If you want fruit tastes, add fresh fruit to your plate at the end
* Be careful with adding chocolate, it burns easily and gets messed up, but done right can make nice chocolate pancakes
* Be careful with adding blueberries, you will not be able to see if they are ready or burned
* Don't use vanillin sugar, it is just not as good as proper vanilla sugar (edited) 

Really nice combos are what you might expect:

* Fruits, especially bananas as they combine very well with maple syrup
* Whipped cream, because you can never have to much fat, right
* Lemon curd + Mascarpone mixed together
