# Ninja Creami Deluxe

## Basic Protein Ice Cream Recipe
 
- 3.5 dl low-fat milk
- 1.5-2 scoops protein powder (Gold Standard Extreme Milk Shake recommended)
- 15g collagen

- Mix in shaker, pour into Creami container
- Optional: add milk up to fill line for more volume
- Let sit 10 min at room temperature to settle
- Freeze for 24 hours

## Alternative Thickeners

- **Collagen**: Creates creamy texture, flavorless, more expensive (~30€/kg)
- **Vanilla pudding powder**: 3 tbsp, adds flavor and sugar, cheaper (~10€/kg)
- **Sport Life Protein Pudding powder**: 20g + 30g whey protein + 5dl low-fat milk (~400 kcal per container, ~2€)

## Kid-Friendly Recipes

- **Strawberry jam ice cream**: Low-fat milk + 3 tbsp strawberry jam (instant hit)
- **Frozen yogurt**: Regular yogurt filled near max line, freeze, run on frozen yogurt setting, add couple spoonfuls milk, re-spin
- **Berry ice cream**: Frozen berries + milk (needs more flavor than fresh)
- **Pineapple sorbet**: Canned pineapple
- **Slushie**: Pear juice

## Flavor Notes

- Chocolate needs 1.5-2x normal drinking strength
- Taste matches what protein powder tastes like in shaker
- Low-fat versions melt faster than fatty ice creams, less stable
- Skim milk makes it watery - use low-fat milk instead

## Usage Tips

- Let container sit at room temperature 10-15 min before processing (longer for low-fat versions)
- Run warm tap water over container exterior before inserting into machine to prevent edge freezing issues
- Straight from freezer = too cold to eat comfortably
- Runs quietly enough to use while kids sleep
- Slight ozone smell from motor is normal

## Flavor Combos That Work

- Chocolate-Toffee pudding powder + Chocolate Hazelnut Gold Standard
- Lohilo dupe: 1 scoop Lohilo protein powder + 1 scoop vanilla whey + low-fat milk to fill line
- Glögi ice cream
